                    "question": "what is a sequence-to-sequence model in rnn",
                    "answer": "A sequence-to-sequence model in RNN is used for tasks where the input and output are both sequences, such as in machine translation or speech recognition."

                    "question": "how is gan trained",
                    "answer": "GANs are trained using an adversarial process where the generator creates fake data and the discriminator tries to differentiate between real and fake data. Both networks improve iteratively during training."

                {
                    "question": "what is the role of the discriminator in gan",
                    "answer": "The discriminator's role in GAN is to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator. It provides feedback to the generator to help it improve."

                    "question": "what is the role of the input layer in a neural network",
                    "answer": "The input layer in a neural network receives raw data and passes it to the next layer for further processing. It serves as the starting point of the network’s information flow."

                    "question": "what is an activation function in neural networks",
                    "answer": "An activation function introduces non-linearity to the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns in the data. Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh."
