  {
    "question": "What neural network is suitable for natural language processing for text generation?",
    "answer": "Transformer-based models like GPT-3. GPT-3 is specifically designed for text generation and excels in producing coherent, contextually relevant text. Other models, like LSTM, also generate text, but Transformer-based models are more efficient and accurate in handling long-range dependencies and producing high-quality text."
  },
  {
    "question": "What neural network can be used for image segmentation?",
    "answer": "U-Net or Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). U-Net is specifically designed for image segmentation tasks, especially in medical imaging, and provides high accuracy by using skip connections. FCNs are also effective for segmentation tasks but may not provide the same level of precision as U-Net in specific domains."
  },
  {
    "question": "What neural network is suitable for recommender systems?",
    "answer": "Collaborative Filtering or Deep Learning-based models. Collaborative filtering is effective when user-item interactions are sparse and works well for personalized recommendations based on user preferences. Deep learning models, like neural collaborative filtering, can provide more accurate and dynamic recommendations by learning complex patterns in user data."
  },
  {
    "question": "What neural network can be used for text classification?",
    "answer": "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). While RNNs are ideal for handling sequential data, CNNs can also be used for text classification tasks, particularly for identifying local features in text, such as key phrases or topics. CNNs are generally faster and may perform better for shorter texts, while RNNs are better for processing longer, more complex sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What neural network is suitable for machine translation?",
    "answer": "Sequence-to-Sequence models or Transformer-based models. Sequence-to-sequence models work by encoding the input sequence and then decoding it into the output sequence, making them suitable for translation. Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT have largely replaced sequence-to-sequence models because they capture dependencies more effectively and can handle longer sequences."
  },
  {
    "question": "What neural network can be used for facial recognition?",
    "answer": "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or DeepFace. CNNs are widely used for facial recognition as they automatically learn features from images to identify faces. DeepFace, developed by Facebook, is a deep learning framework based on CNNs that has been optimized for facial recognition, providing higher accuracy than traditional CNN models."
